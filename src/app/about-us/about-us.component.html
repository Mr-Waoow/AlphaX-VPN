          Alpha-x project was founded and develops now by professional team who know needs of customers
          more than anyone else. We created this service for our needs: comfortable work with e-mail
          marketing, mass registrations in social networks and other matters where we needed to use
          reliable and fast proxies.
        </p>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          Since 2016, our services are available to you. In less than a year we became leaders of the
          rental proxy market and we still continue to improve!
        </p>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          We want our customers to be able to use our* proxies with any kind of special software. Thatâ€™s
          why we are always in touch with software developers.
        </p>
